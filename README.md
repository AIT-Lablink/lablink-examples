# AIT Lablink examples

This repository contains simple yet instructive example setups (clients, configuration, scripts) for running the [AIT Lablink](https://ait-lablink.readthedocs.io).
These examples are intended to showcase the basics of Lablink usage to new users, enabling them to start developing their own Lablink applications and setups.
Step-by-step instructions for running these examples can be found [online](https://ait-lablink.readthedocs.io/projects/ait-lablink-examples).
